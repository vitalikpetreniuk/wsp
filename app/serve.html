							<h2>Families and Individuals</h2>
							<p>Many families and individuals come to us and realize that their financial house is not in order, meaning they lack a fully comprehensive financial plan. They’ve been led to believe they do have a financial plan because they have a 401(k) or an investment account, while lacking essentials like a will, estate plan, proper liability coverage, or healthcare directives. We ensure the families and individuals we serve not only have the best portfolio management, but also remain protected and well-positioned for the future.</p>
							<p>Our mission is to serve as your financial advisors for life, handling all matters related to managing and preserving your wealth, and building your legacy–so you can focus on enjoying your life and the people important to it.</p>

							<p>With retirees living longer, more active lives, it’s essential for your retirement plan to work for you.

We also talk about the things that concern you, and strategies that can help alleviate those concerns. As your lifestyle changes, we update your financial plan to keep you moving in the direction you want to go.</p>
							<p>We also strive to ensure that your wealth passes in the most efficient way to your heirs and philanthropic endeavors through estate and legacy planning. With our help, you have a full range of resources at your disposal.</p>
